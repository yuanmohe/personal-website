Hello, world! I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Methodology](https://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology) and the [Data Science Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/DSI) at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/). I hold a MSc in Applied Social Data Science from LSE and a BSc in Social Sciences from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). 

My PhD research examines how daily behaviours and social interactions reflect and reinforce socioeconomic inequality, using large-scale digital trace data and advanced computational methods (such as machine learning, natural language processing, and social network analysis). More broadly, I am interested in not only harnessing the potential of data science and AI to improve our understanding of society and humanity, but also evaluating the impacts of such technologies. Relevantly, I have a growing interest in AI policy and ethics.
